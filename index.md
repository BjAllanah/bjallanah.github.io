## About Me

Hi, I'm Bj Allanah, a student interested in designing a graphical user interface for playing Sudoku.  
This project was part of my final quest in Computer Programming, and it reflects what I’ve learned about creativity, coding, and implementing what I've learned.

## About My Project

**Project Title:** *User Interface Sudoku*   
**One-line pitch:** “A game of Sudoku where you choose between easy, normal, and hard depending on the interactive 9x9 grid you receive.

> Curious about what I’d do differently or recommend to others? Read my final thoughts here: I recommend paying attention in this class and finding ways to implement the ideologies we take away into the real world. (_posts/2025-05-23-tip.md)
