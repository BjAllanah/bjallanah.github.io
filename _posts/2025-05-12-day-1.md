### What I Set Out to Do
My plan was to design and set up the basic GUI layout like the grid and input fields. Today I want to design the grid, and add selection buttons for easy, normal and hard. I wanted to see if I could do this with just the knowledge I have, using the training and experiences to my aid.

### What I Actually Did
In reality, because I wanted to create a user interface, and I didn't know how to, I use Youtube videos online to help me create a game. Through rigorous research, I learned that tkinter would work best for my design, so I scrolled on Youtube learning on how to implement tkinter into my code. When I finished, I managed to create the 9x9 grid, while implementing difficulty ratings in the same day. I also had to install it aswell, which took me some time, because colab notebook doesn't have the GUI installed already. Regarding creating the difficulty, I looked up some tips online on how to create a dropbox, and the process was similar to things I've seen in previous training, as with the indexing game in one of the earlier textbooks. Some other things I ended up doing was having to create multiple functions, just to satisfy my goals for day 1-2. Later I had realized that tkinter wasn't working for me, and with some further research, I learned that tkinter wouldn't work under the conditions of Google Colab. With the research I did, I found that by importing ipywidgets into my code, I could bypass download all the software, and simply write my code. I'll provide screenshots of my finished code for day 1 and 2.

### What I Learned or Noticed

I learned that I shouldn't give up, as very often throughout this day, I felt the need to stop, because I thought it was becoming too difficult for me. While working, I received random boost of motivation from myself, due to the fact I realized how cool the game would actually be if I went through with my plan. Another thing was to not get stuck if you don't know where to go. With this project, I was given a lot of leeway to venture off and learn new things, while implementing techniques from previous classes. During classes, we discussed for loops, and I realized that I could use them to create my grid.

### What's Next

[What do you plan to tackle in the next stage of your project?]
I plan to implement input validation and number validation into my coding next, as those are key for a smooth user experience for my game.
