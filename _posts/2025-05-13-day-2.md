title: "Day 2 - Finishing the Grid"
---

### What I Set Out to Do
My plan today was to finish with creating the 9x9 grid, by utilizing the information I gathered from the experiences and training, rather than looking online.
I planned to finish the input fields by creating the boxes, and adding inputs.

### What I Actually Did
In reality, I ended up not using tkinter and ipy widgets, as i felt that was too complicated, and decided to stick to the basics I've learned.
While I felt would probably be cooler if I did, the time it consumed became too much to fit to with my schedule.
I also didn't feel like I was genuinely doing it myself, as I had to rely on alot of Youtube videos to help me learn how to use
extension. So I ended up starting all over again, but this time, I just imported random. From there, I created multiple functions like last time, but similar to the level-up we had. We were creating rows and columns.
I think the most tedious process of my whole design was figuring out how to validate if previous number were already in boxes. With the help
of trainings and overviews of experiences, I was able to design the entire grid, which allows the user to include the difficulty rating from easy, normal, and hard mode.

### What I Learned or Noticed

I learned that I should over overcomplicate things. I spent the whole first day planning things that I wouldn't use later on in my project, and because of that,
I ended up backtracking and fixing everything. Another thing was to really spend time going through previous assignment, finding peculiar
ways to find way to fix my code.

### What's Next

[What do you plan to tackle in the next stage of your project?]
In my next stage, I plan to ensure that there are no errors in the base of my code, as it will be harder to find errors when I've finished everything.
