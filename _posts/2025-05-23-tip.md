## What’s One Thing You’d Tell Someone Starting This Course?

Looking back, what’s one piece of advice you’d give to someone just beginning this project or course? What helped you most—whether it was a mindset, habit, or practical strategy? 

Don’t worry if everything feels overwhelming at first—start small and build one feature at a time. The biggest thing that helped me was breaking down the project into manageable parts and focusing on just one task a day. Even if your first version isn’t perfect, getting something working is better than getting stuck trying to make it perfect from the start.

## What Did You Learn That Might Stick With You?

What did this project teach you—about programming, learning, or yourself? You can talk about a specific concept you finally understood, a skill you improved, or a moment you felt proud of your work or proud of yourself!

One thing that really stuck with me was how important structure and logic are in programming. Working on the Sudoku puzzle taught me how to think step-by-step, trace through code, and really understand how different parts of a program connect. I also learned how satisfying it feels to finally solve a bug that’s been bothering me for hours, as it's like solving a mini-puzzle inside a bigger puzzle.

## What Helped You Get Through Challenges?

How did you handle bugs, confusion, or lack of motivation? What would you tell someone who hits a roadblock and isn’t sure how to keep going?

Whenever I hit a bug or felt stuck, I took a step back and carefully examined the logic out slowly. I also learned to test things one small piece at a time instead of trying to fix everything at once. What helped the most was reminding myself that getting stuck is part of the process, not a sign I was doing something wrong. The patience I had really paid off in the end.

## What’s Next for You?

What are you planning to focus on after this class—another project, a different course, an artistic or academic goal? Even if it’s not related to CS, how might the skills you practiced here (like logical thinking, problem-solving, or creative debugging) show up in the future?

After this project, I want to keep improving this game, maybe by adding a simple graphical interface or adding features like hint buttons or a timer. Beyond that, I’m interested in exploring more about game design or interactive programs. Even if I don’t stick with computer science long-term, the logical thinking and problem-solving skills I practiced here will definitely help in other areas of life, which is the main reason I chose this project, as I deemed it a good practical application for everyday use.
