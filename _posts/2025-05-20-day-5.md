title: "Day 5 - Validations, and finishing game
---

### What I Set Out to Do
My plan was finish all the validation for my game, and fixing polishing the playing frame for a smoother experience

### What I Actually Did
Today, I finished editing my code for user_input. Today, I realized that I still had to make some changes. For examples, I added instructions
to the games layout, so that anyone accessing my code can have a smooth experience. I also added the ability to quit my game, if someone didn't want to play it anymore or wanted to choose
a different difficulty, I created that so they would have that option.

### What I Learned or Noticed
I learned how to create instructions for my game. At first, I was overthinking it, because I would have to add multiple conditional statements for no reason. 
I then noticed that I could just add a bunch of print statements which would be there everytime they booted up my code.

### What's Next

[What do you plan to tackle in the next stage of your project?]
I plan to finish my game for tomorrow, so that I can get the full experience of my work over the course of this semester
