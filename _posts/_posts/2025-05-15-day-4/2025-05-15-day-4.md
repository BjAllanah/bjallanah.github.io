title: "Day 4 - Finishing grid, and testing input"
---

### What I Set Out to Do
My plan was to create wall for my 9x9 grid, and finish adding validations for my code.

### What I Actually Did
Today, I finished editing my code for user_input. Today, I made some changes, as I figued I didn't check for everything. Specifically, checking
for whether you input something invalid, it keeps on going for that input. I wanted to change that so it stops, and simulate the same thing again, but
 this time you start over trying to make the correct input this time. I also added walls in between the 3x3 grids within the 9x9 grid, so that the game looks easier to play. I did this by modifying my print_grid function where basically, for every row and column after 2 and 5,
 it would print "| ". I created this because it would add walls at columns 3 and 6. I also had to add the bottom walls aswell, but I added those after print(row_str), as that adds the number of row and dots that will be used to verify the walls.

### What I Learned or Noticed
I noticed that for my function user_input, I had to create multiple else statements after the if statements that converts the strings to int according to their index in the function.
Another things is that I needed each  condition to be checked one at a time, and this could only work if I utilized a lot of them. If one of the conditional statements fails, then it skipped the nested loop.

### What's Next

[What do you plan to tackle in the next stage of your project?]
My next steps are to decorate my game, adding a welcoming at the start of the game. I want to make my sudoku interface look appealing, so that it can attract to the masses of our class. I want to have a fully fledged menu aswell, that can be be effectively interacted with.
