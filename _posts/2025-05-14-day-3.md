title: "Day 3 - Number Validation"
---

### What I Set Out to Do
My plan today was to finish the number validation for my code, so that I could randomize numbers across my 9x9 grid.
---

### What I Actually Did
I started on creating a function called user_input. In this function, I checked for where the row, column, and number that is entered
fits within the range of 1-9 that I set earlier. I struggled with figuring out how to do this first, as I had to create an empty list first. I then
had to split the characters and spaces apart using if statements. If the char equaled a number in ' ', then it would add it to the space in " ". It would then add that number
to a empty list input_values, using .append. I then verified that the user inputs 3 values, by use the len() function to check if there are 3 values in input_values. I then made an else statement
that if there were 3 values, those values would be converted from strings to integers. I used the numbers 0, 1, and 2 in brackets because those were the places of the indexes.

### What I Learned or Noticed

I noticed that many times, my code wouldn't work, and it was typically due to mispositions of my code. Many times, I would have if statements out of place, which hindered my progress
slightly. I was able to cover all the validations I could think of, making sure that each input would fit within the range of 1-9.
I learned to also include clear and consise comments. I wrote alot of code, and I want the user that reads my code to understand the steps I took to get where I was.


### What's Next

[What do you plan to tackle in the next stage of your project?]
My next step in the project is to try and add hints or auto-solvers to my code. I figured that to do that, I need my code to create a randomized 9x9 grid puzzle, while
storing the solved puzzle in it's memory. After I do that, I can use if statements to set up situations where if the user input something wrong, then the computer can give hints on the correct number, 
because it already has the answers stored.
