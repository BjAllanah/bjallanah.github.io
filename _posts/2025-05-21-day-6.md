### What I Set Out to Do
My plan was to finish my game, and to test for any errors that my come along the way.

### What I Actually Did
Today, I finished up my code, while implementing some new functions in there aswell. I struggled a lot today for some reason, as I continued to feel as if my code as not complete, forcing me to come back and look for revisions anywhere.
I realized that I needed to add a function that tells the user when they have filled on the boxes on the grid, or won the game. This was tedious at first because I didn't know where to organize it among the various functions I've created, but once I got the hang of things. I was able to implement it into my user_input
function and call it into other functions so it would work. I also created a solve_grid function, as the generated grids I created were never truly complete, as you could still have a repititon of numbers in the same 3x3 grid or same row or column. This was an issue at first, because something I'd spent so many work days on; I felt had gone to waste. 
That was then till I realized all I need to do was fix my identation from my previous code, and tweak it a bit to differentiate it from my past code. I also changed the way numbers would generate on a grid. Instead, it would start of with 81 numbers already filled, and based on the difficulty, would remove numbers as the difficulty increased. I used the -= operators =, which was the opposite of the += operator, and it came in handy in this function.
In the process howver, I ended up creating two more functions, as I needed to test for further validity and to randomize number in the 3x3 grids 1-9.

### What I Learned or Noticed
Something I learned was that it was a lot more simpler to understand my code when I was make it easier to understand. To get the gist of what I'm saying, instead of having multiple lines of code, I realized I could just combine them all together, and that would give me the same results.


### What's Next

[What do you plan to tackle in the next stage of your project?]
I plan to test for any more errors, and to get my final blog post out.
