### Project Focus

[I want to create a graphical user interface for playing Sudoku. The goal is to create an interactive 9x9 Sudoku grid where users can input numbers, get visual feedback, check if their solution is correct, and possibly even auto-solve or get hints. My title will be User Interface Sudoku and will allow players to choose between easy, normal, and hard.

### Why This Project 

This project combines multiple topics we've covered in the course, and I've always like sudoku since a young age. Sudoku is a well-known puzzle game , and building a playable version would require me to challenge myself, while diving into the world of creating both user interface designs and algorithmic checks, making it a great practical application for myself. I chose this idea because I felt it was fun, and being able to create a game using the code I learned allows me to actually make use of it, rather than it keeping it stored in my brain.

### What I Want to Learn

I want to strengthen my concepts of functions and potential loops; while practicing with handling multiple functions. I'm hoping to build some good problem solving skills, that can be carried into my every day life, along with perserverance aswell, as I'm realizing now that my project will be harder than I thought.



### My Approach 

I plan to track my progress like this, but the actual times in which I get these things done may vary.: 
Day 1–3: Design and set up the basic GUI layout like the grid and input fields.

Day 4: Implement input validation and number validation.

Day 5–6: Add correctness to my puzzle, ensuring there's no errors in the base of my design.

Day 7–9: Implement optional features like hints or auto-solver.

Day 10–11: Add finishing touches like the menus, error messages, and instructions.

Day 12–13: Test thoroughly and fix bugs.

Day 14: Prepare presentation and finish implementation.

### What's Next

I plan to actually finish creating an interactive Sudoku game, and in doing so actually feel challenged over these next few weeks.
